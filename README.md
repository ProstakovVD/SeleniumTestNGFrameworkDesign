# SeleniumTestNGFrameworkDesign
This is a Java-based automation framework designed to test the functionality of the practice 
e-commerce "dummywebsite". The goal of this framework is to build a scalable and 
easy-to-maintain solution from scratch. To achieve this, the framework is based on the Page 
Object Model, which helps in creating a more robust and maintainable test suite. The framework 
is supported by TestNG, which allows to setup and manage test execution.

Test execution does not contain errors, but screenshot functionality is fully workable.
So in case when something goes wrong the screen of the error page will be saved in 
/reports folder
